By default XOffset and YOffset are 32 . bindToggleItem \u00b6 {chainable} icon : bindToggleItem ( guiObjectOrLayerCollector ) Binds a GuiObject or LayerCollector to appear and disappeared when the icon is toggled. unbindToggleItem \u00b6 {chainable} icon : unbindToggleItem ( guiObjectOrLayerCollector ) Unbinds the given GuiObject or LayerCollector from the toggle. bindEvent \u00b6 {chainable} icon : bindEvent ( iconEventName , eventFunction ) Connects to an icon event based upon the given iconEventName and call eventFunction with arguments (self, ...) when the event is triggered. unbindEvent \u00b6 {chainable} icon : unbindEvent ( iconEventName ) Unbinds the connection of the associated iconEventName . bindToggleKey \u00b6 {chainable} icon : bindToggleKey ( keyCodeEnum ) Binds a keycode which toggles the icon when pressed. unbindToggleKey \u00b6 {chainable} icon : unbindToggleKey ( keyCodeEnum ) Unbinds the given keycode. lock \u00b6 {chainable} icon : lock () Prevents the icon from being pressed and toggled. unlock \u00b6 {chainable} icon : unlock () Enables the icon to be pressed and toggled. setTopPadding \u00b6 {chainable} icon : setTopPadding ( offset , scale ) The gap between the top of the screen and the icon. setTip \u00b6 {chainable} icon : setTip ( text ) Sets a tip.
